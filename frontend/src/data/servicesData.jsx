  description: "Thyroid and neck surgeries are specialized procedures performed to treat a variety of conditions affecting the thyroid gland, lymph nodes, and surrounding neck structures. These surgeries range from removing part or all of the thyroid gland to excising benign or malignant nodules, managing tumors, and addressing enlarged lymph nodes. Our center offers expert surgical care using advanced techniques to ensure optimal outcomes, minimize complications, and preserve vital functions such as voice and calcium regulation.",

  "name": "Hemithyroidectomy (Partial Thyroid Removal)",
  "description": "Hemithyroidectomy, also known as thyroid lobectomy or partial thyroidectomy, is a surgical procedure where one lobe of the thyroid gland and part of the isthmus are removed. It is commonly done for localized nodules, early thyroid cancers, or cosmetic reasons. Since only half of the gland is removed, many patients continue to have normal thyroid function without needing lifelong medication.",
  "details": {
    "whenNeeded": "Performed when a thyroid nodule, early thyroid cancer, or a unilateral goiter is confined to one side of the thyroid, or for cosmetic removal of visible lumps.",
    "preparation": "Thyroid function tests, ultrasound, and possibly fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. Fasting 6–8 hours before surgery.",
    "rehabilitation": "Most patients return to normal activities in 1–2 weeks. Temporary hoarseness or neck discomfort may occur but usually resolve. Regular thyroid function monitoring is needed."

  "benefits": [
    "Removes problematic thyroid tissue while preserving half the gland.",
    "Lower chance of needing lifelong thyroid hormone replacement compared to total thyroidectomy.",
